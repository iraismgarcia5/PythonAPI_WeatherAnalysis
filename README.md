# Python API - What's the Weather Like as We Approach the Equator?

In this project, I was tasked with creaitng a Python script to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator. To accomplish this, I utilitzed a simple Python library and the OpenWeatherMap API to create a representative model of weather across world cities.

I built plots to showcase the following relationships:
* Temperature (F) vs. Latitude

* Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
* Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude

* Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude
